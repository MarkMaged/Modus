Factors to take into consideration:

1- Add comments in your code to make it more readable.
2- Don't use px, you can use % when you want to add width and vh when you want to add height.
3- Don't use inline or internal style.
4- It's obligatory to use float propret.
5- You need to use position property to move elements from one place to another. (Search about it if you don't know how to use it).
6- Search about how to do overlay on an image to apply it on header.
